        <p>You go to the window and you see a shadowy figure on the street before you. They seem to be in a cross like pose arms forming a straight line from end to end, hands pointed downward. You can not see their face as it is bent downwards covered in shadows. You still want to close the window but if you move the window it might get that person's attention.</p>
