        <p>Making your way to the village you begin to feel the heat of the sun scorch at your back. The light becomes so bright that seeing becomes difficult as if the piercing rays are trying to unconver the darkness within your soul.

But then you see the stares of the crowd and begin to feel uneasy. There seens to be a auro of hostility and disappointment, and you begin to feel as if you've done something wrong </p>
